# Scientific Programming in Python module ReadMe
Scientific Programming in Python was a first year module I took during my Physics Bachelors degree. I enjoyed this module and found it challenging at times.
Each homework file has it's specifications for completion contained within it, and the project specification was the following:

# Exoplanets
Aim: explore exoplanets and their host stars using matplotlib visualisations and the tabulated data from http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/
You could consider:
• Kepler’s Laws
• Exoplanet mass determination from radial velocity
• Mass-radius relationship and density
• … and other extensions of your choice
